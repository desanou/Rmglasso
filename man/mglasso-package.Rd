\title{mglasso: Multiscale Graphical Lasso}
\description{
Inference of Multiscale graphical models with neighborhood selection approach. The method is based on solving a convex optimization problem combining a Lasso and fused-group Lasso penalties. This allows to infer simultaneously a conditional independence graph and a clustering partition. The optimization is based on the Continuation with Nesterov smoothing in a Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm solver (Hadj-Selem et al. 2018) \doi{10.1109/TMI.2018.2829802} implemented in python.
