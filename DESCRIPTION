Description: Inference of Multiscale graphical models with neighborhood
    selection approach.  The method is based on solving a convex
    optimization problem combining a Lasso and fused-group Lasso
    penalties.  This allows to infer simultaneously a conditional
    independence graph and a clustering partition. The optimization is
    based on the Continuation with Nesterov smoothing in a
    Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm solver (Hadj-Selem et al. 2018)
    <doi:10.1109/TMI.2018.2829802> implemented in python.
