Description: Inference of multiscale graphical models with neighborhood selection approach. 
    The method is based on solving a convex optimization problem combining a Lasso and fused-group Lasso penalties.
    This allows to infer simultaneously a conditional independence graph and a clustering partition. The optimization is 
    based on the CONESTA solver (Hadj-Selem et al. 2018) implemented in python.
